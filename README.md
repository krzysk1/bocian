The SZD-9 Bocian (Polish: "Stork") is a multi-purpose two-seat sailplane that was designed and built in Poland at Szybowcowy Zakład Doświadczalny (Glider Experimental Works) in Bielsko-Biała, beginning in 1952. It was designed to be capable of fulfilling the needs of every area from training to competition flying. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Use it at your own risk!

Note from AJ MacLeod:
---------------------
This model of a Bocian-1E / SZD-9 glider is released under the terms of the
GPLv2.

The FDM is not yet accurate and I would welcome help in testing and improving
it.

Thanks are due to;

My wife and son, for not complaining too much about the time spent on modelling
stuff for FG :-)

Jakub Klawiter (and Piotr Szymanski) for the wealth of great photos and videos
he supplied me with and gave permission to use in this model, for making a
special trip to the gliding club in the middle of winter to take specifically
requested photos, for locating (and most importantly, translating!) a Bocian flight
manual and for providing information on flight characteristics.

Maik Justus, for his great work in implementing the superb aerotow and winch
launching features and making glider models possible with YASim, his help with
this FDM config, and not forgetting his work on making landing on water with a
glider as dangerous as it should be ;-)

Dave Perry for the pilot models.  If anyone wants to volunteer a mugshot to
let me have two non-identical twin pilots, feel free to send it this way :-)
